# findindate
Simple search for files in a specific date
 
How many files you've created yesterday?
How can I archive your files of 2016?
Is it possible to delete my files of July 2017?

If you have asked these question once, so this tool is for you.

available by GNU find but work with dates is very hard so I had created this litle script to simplify these jobs.
